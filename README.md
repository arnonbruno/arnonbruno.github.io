# Arnon Bruno V.

**AI Engineer and PhD Candidate in Artificial Intelligence**  
Federal University of Paran√°, Curitiba, Brazil  

I'm a passionate AI researcher, PhD candidate, and Principal AI Engineer specializing in Artificial Intelligence. My expertise lies in Neural Networks, Deep Learning, AI Agents, and Autonomous Control Systems, with a strong focus on applying AI to solve real-world energy consumption problems.
Currently, my research revolves around developing a neural network controller for heavy-duty vehicle gearboxes using differentiable programming, optimizing energy efficiency in transportation.
Beyond academia, I have hands-on experience in AI applications across industries, having worked as a Senior Data Scientist at Volvo Trucks, a Senior Data Analytics Advisor at ExxonMobil, and a Senior Data Scientist at Junto Seguros.
I‚Äôm also passionate about AI education, serving as a Teaching Assistant for AI-focused courses at the University of Chicago and Brown University - School of Professional Studies, where I help bridge the gap between AI research and business applications.
I strongly believe in leveraging AI to optimize energy use and drive impactful innovation.
